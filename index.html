        <h3 id="achievement">Some of Mr. Ali's achievements:</h3>
        
        <ul class="container">
            
            <li>Mr. Ali was born <strong>January 17, 1942 in Louisville,Kentucky</strong></li>
            <li>He began training as an amateur boxer at age 12. At 18, he won a gold medal in the light heavyweight division at the
            1960 Summer Olympics and turned professional later that year</li>
            <li>He won the world heavyweight championship from Sonny Liston in a major upset on February 25, 1964, at age 22</li>
            <li>Mr. Ali dominated boxing in the 1960s and 1970s and held the heavyweight title three times. His fights were among the
            most memorable and spectacular in history.</li>
            <li>Ali's actions as a conscientious objector to the Vietnam War made him an icon for the larger 1960s counterculture
            generation and he was a very high-profile figure of racial pride for African Americans during the civil rights movement and
            throughout his career. As a Muslim, Ali was initially affiliated with Elijah Muhammad's Nation of Islam (NOI). He
            later disavowed the NOI, adhering to Sunni Islam, and supported racial integration like his former mentor Malcolm X.</li>
            <li>Outside of boxing, Ali attained success as a spoken word artist, releasing two studio albums: I Am the Greatest! (1963)
            and The Adventures of Ali and His Gang vs. Mr. Tooth Decay (1976). Both albums received Grammy Award nominations.</li>
            <li>He also featured as an actor and writer, releasing two autobiographies.</li>
           <li>Mr. Ali died <strong>June 3, 2016(aged 74) in Arizona</strong></li>
